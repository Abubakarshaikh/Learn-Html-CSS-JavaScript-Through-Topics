    <div class="text-box">
        <p>
            "The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although, there is good
            in
            each. Desire
            that which will bring you benefit, and seek help from Allah and do not give way to incapacity. If
            something
            happens to
            you, do not say, 'If only I had done such-and-such.' Rather say, 'The decree of Allah. He does what He
            will.'
            Otherwise
            you will open yourself up to the action of Shaitan."

            "Once the Prophet was asked: 'Tell us, which action is dearest to Allah?' He answered: 'To say your
            prayer
            at
            its proper
            time.' Again he was asked: 'What comes next?' Mohammad said: 'To show kindness to parents.' 'Then what?'
            he
            was
            asked,
            'To strive for the cause of Allah!'"
